My First Flask App Tutorial

This is my first introduction to using Flask and Python.  It is a direct step by
step following of Brad Traversy's Python Flask from Scratch Youtube Series.

This tutorial introduced me to the Flask framework and some of its syntax, as well
as the MySQL/MariaDB program and its syntax.

There was a lot of troubleshooting with this one as getting MariaDB to 'talk' to Flask
was somewhat of a challenge, although it was also quite enlightening as to the basics
of how front and backend programs interact.

More versions to come, two videos to the tutorial are left.
